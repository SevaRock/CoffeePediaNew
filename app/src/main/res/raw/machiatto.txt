Caffè macchiato (Italian pronunciation: [kafˈfɛ mmakˈkjaːto]),[1] sometimes called espresso macchiato,[2][3] is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted" so the literal translation of caffè macchiato is "stained coffee", or coffee with a spot of milk.

History
The origin of the name "macchiato" stems from baristas needing to show the serving waiters the difference between an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk in it; the latter was "marked". The idea is reflected in the Portuguese name for the drink: café pingado, meaning coffee with a drop.[4]

Preparation

The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients. The intent is that the milk moderates, rather than overwhelms, the taste of the coffee while adding a touch of sweetness. The drink is typically prepared by spooning a small amount of hot foamed milk directly onto a single shot of espresso.[5] One recipe calls for 1-2 teaspoons of milk heated to 140-150F (60-65C).[6]
